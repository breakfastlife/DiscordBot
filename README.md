A bot created for Discord. 

Currently you need to register the bot through discord before using it. 

It usues Youtube to play music. The queue works but currently cannot play playlists.

Commands:

$join
$play <title>
$skip
$stop
$resume
$pause
$leave
$meme 
---- $meme will post a random meme

Currently, it works by downloading the songs from the queue as they go. The issue with that is that its slow. If I can download the songs as I put them in the queue instead of right before they play, then it'll be much faster.

This new build should have the following:
1. Ability to queue and download
2. take playlists but only download a section of them to keep down on space. 
3. figure out how environment secrets work through github.
